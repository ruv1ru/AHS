<p>Come and enjoy our comfortable 2-storey townhouse NEAR TO THE CITY CENTRE and harbour foreshores. Catching the ferry to the city and travelling under the harbour bridge then returning from outside the beautifully restored Queen Victoria building in the midst of the city centre is an experience for all guests. This peaceful location is frequented by a great community of locals having picnics in the park, taking dogs for a walk, children to the playground or playing tennis. Its also a 5-10 walk to the cafes, restaurants, hotels and interesting shops of Balmain and Rozelle.

    An indoor gym, swimming pool and spa are all FREE, for your use. Save the first night on arrival to have a complimentary dinner with us. Light breakfasts are complimentary. A hearty dinner welcomes you in the evenings, if required, for a reasonable rate. Wi-Fi is available too for a small contribution and it is also free close by at the local library.</p>
